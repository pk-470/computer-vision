An overview of the experiments performed can be seen in the notebook imageSegmentation_demo.ipynb, found in the Code directory. 

To perform segmentation on a custom image run the following command from within the Code directory:

> python imageSegmentation.py -image [-r] [-c] [-feature_type]

The segmented image plots will be stored in the same directory as the original image.
